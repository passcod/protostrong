# ðŸŒˆ Armstrong

_A job framework for a wonderful world._

Adds rich job control, composition, and monitoring on top of an ordinary queue.

Built on top of [Gearman], but could support different backend queues without
too much effort. Pull requests doing so are welcome, and [documentation for the
backend interface is available](./docs/backend-interface.md).

[Gearman]: http://gearman.org
