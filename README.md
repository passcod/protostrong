You'll need to enter your sudo password and some configuration details.

## Install (manual)

1. Install armstrong globally: `npm i -g armstrong`
2. Add the Systemd service unit: `armstrong install --systemd-unit | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/armstrong.service`
3. Create the configuration file: `armstrong install --config-file | sudo tee /etc/armstrong.toml`
4. Edit the configuration to suit
5. Start the service: `sudo systemctl start armstrong`
5. Enable the service: `sudo systemctl enable armstrong`
